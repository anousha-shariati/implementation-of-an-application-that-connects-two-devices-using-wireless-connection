multimedia systems first project spring 2024 

This project implements a network-based communication system between two devices, enabling the exchange of audio and video files over TCP. The system allows users to capture a frame from their webcam and record a 30-second audio clip, which are then sent to a target device and displayed/played upon receipt.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to leverage programming languages and network knowledge to create a simple, yet effective, communication system between two computers or laptops.


Project Structure:

Image Capture: A script to capture a single frame from the webcam, converting it to an image file.

Audio Recording: A script to record 30 seconds of audio and save it as a file.

Networking: A TCP Winsocket-based connection setup, allowing file transfer between devices.

Data Handling: File reception and playback/display functions to handle incoming data.

Prerequisites:

Python 3

Webcam and microphone access on both devices

Network connectivity (WiFi or Ethernet)
